**COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python**

This project involves an extensive analysis of COVID-19 data using Python to understand the pandemic's spread, impact, and trends over time. By utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we clean, process, and analyze large datasets containing information on cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates across different regions.

Key aspects of the analysis include tracking the progression of cases over time, identifying hotspots, and examining the effectiveness of public health interventions. We perform time-series analysis to model the growth of the virus and use forecasting techniques to predict future trends. Additionally, we explore demographic data to understand how different populations have been affected.

The project also visualizes the data through dynamic charts and heatmaps, offering clear insights into the pandemic's trajectory. This analysis is crucial for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in making informed decisions and preparing for future public health challenges.
